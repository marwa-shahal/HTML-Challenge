        <h2>A City in Lebanon</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Tripoli</b> (Arabic: طرابلس/ALA-LC:<i>Ṭarābulus</i>,<sup>[a]</sup> Lebanese Arabic: <i>Ṭrablus</i>) is
            the largest city in northern Lebanon and the second-largest city in the country. Situated 81 km (50 mi)
            north of the capital Beirut, it is the capital of the North Governorate and the Tripoli District. Tripoli
            overlooks the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and it is the northernmost seaport in Lebanon. It holds a string of
            four small islands offshore. The Palm Islands were declared a protected area because of their status of
            haven for endangered loggerhead turtles (Chelona mydas), rare monk seals and migratory birds. Tripoli
            borders the city of El Mina, the port of the Tripoli District, which it is geographically conjoined with to
            form the greater Tripoli conurbation.
        </p>

            The history of Tripoli dates back at least to the 14th century BCE. The city is well known for containing
            the Mansouri Great Mosque and the largest Crusader fortress in Lebanon, the Citadel of Raymond de
            Saint-Gilles. It has the second highest concentration of Mamluk architecture after Cairo.
            In the Arab World, Tripoli is sometimes known as Ṭarābulus al-Sham (Arabic: طرابلس الشام), or Levantine
            Tripoli, to distinguish it from its Libyan counterpart, known as Tripoli-of-the-West (Arabic: طرابلس الغرب‎;
            Ṭarābulus al-Gharb).
            With the formation of Lebanon and the 1948 breakup of the Syrian–Lebanese customs union, Tripoli, once on
            par in economic and commercial importance to Beirut, was cut off from its traditional trade relations with
            the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity.[2]

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Evidence of settlement in Tripoli dates back as early as 1400 BCE. In the 9th century, the Phoenicians
            established a trading station in Tripoli and later, under Persian rule, the city became the center of a
            confederation of the Phoenician city-states of Sidon, Tyre, and Arados Island. Under Hellenistic rule,
            Tripoli was used as a naval shipyard and the city enjoyed a period of autonomy. It came under Roman rule
            around 64 BCE. The 551 Beirut earthquake and tsunami destroyed the Byzantine city of Tripoli along with
            other Mediterranean coastal cities.
